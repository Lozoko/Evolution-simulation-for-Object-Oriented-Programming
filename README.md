# Evolution simulation for Object Oriented Programming subject

This is the final project for the Object Oriented Programming subject. The main idea behind this project was to introduce students to object oriented programing
in Java. This project is a visual simulation of evolution, written in Java and JavaFX. The simulation represents a hypothetical population of creatures, 
who choose their movement depending on their genotype. The "purpose" of individual species is to eat food to gain energy and reproduce. This simulation
shows balance between the amount of available food on the map and number of living creatures. The program, apart from showing a visual representation of the state of the simulation,
 is also capable of collecting and processing statistical data, for example the average life span of creatures or dominating genotype.
